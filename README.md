## Call of Duty - World War II: `eng_code_pre_gfx` Fix

This is the solution to errors encountered when changing the language of Call of Duty World War II from Simplified Chinese to English.

## Error

```js
Fastfile container for zone 'eng_code_pre_gfx' 
is newer than client executable (version 66, expecting 5)
```

## Solution

1. Delete the `simplified_chinese` folder found in the root of Call of Duty WWII.

2. Download this [english](https://github.com/Evavic44/cod-ww2-eng-code-pre-gfx/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) folder, copy the content and paste into your english folder in the game root: size ~ `55mb`

> Overwrite the files if prompted

3. Your game is now in english!

If you still get any errors, try running the game as an `administrator`
